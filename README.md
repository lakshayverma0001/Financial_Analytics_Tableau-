# Financial-Analytics
This project analyzes the competition among the top 500 companies in India based on their market capitalization and quarterly sales. By cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, we ensured data accuracy and usability. Our exploratory data analysis revealed significant variations in market capitalization and a moderate positive correlation with quarterly sales. Key findings highlighted that companies like Reliance Industries and TCS dominate both metrics, with technology, finance, and manufacturing sectors being particularly competitive. Visualizations using bar graphs, pie charts, and cards effectively communicated these insights, providing actionable recommendations for strategic growth and informed investment decisions.
